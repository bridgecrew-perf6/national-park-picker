# national-park-picker
the best app you can find!

## Description

AS A fan of the outdoors and a lover of travel,

I WANT an app that shows me all the national parks with their most vital information

SO THAT I can plan a great vacation. 

National Park Picker is a platform made to explore and plan visits to National Parks within the USA. Fetching information from National Park Service APIs and a weather API, the completed website should allow the user to see the address, photos, activities, tours, and upcoming weather of all national parks, while also providing dynamic links to other useful websites. Furthermore, the website will have the ability to let users rank and save the national parks according to priority, and the home screen will display the user's favorites.

Our job is to build the website so that:

GIVEN a webpage that is incredible and sorts through national parks

WHEN I check the HTML head

THEN I find a link to a CSS framework other than Bootstrap 

WHEN I check online

THEN I see that the site has been deployed to GitHub Pages.

WHEN I use the website

THEN I find interactive elements to it (i.e., accepts and responds to user input).

WHEN I view the Javascript

THEN I find fetches from at least two server-side APIs.

WHEN I am prompted with information or for user input

THEN it is displayed in the form of modals

WHEN I check client-side storage (i.e. localStorage)

THEN I find saved elements that persist on the page

WHEN I click buttons and links or hover over items

THEN the website responds to it

WHEN I view the website from different screen types

THEN the website still works well and looks good

WHEN I check the repository

THEN I find that it meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)

WHEN I look at the README file

THEN I see quality in the flesh staring right back at me (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

You can use the new, clean code as a template in case a new page needs to be added to the website, or as an example to show new coders what good code looks like. An example of the edited code is below. Note the alternate text, the comments, and the semantic HTML elements.
